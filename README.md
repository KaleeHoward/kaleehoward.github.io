# Virtual Resume Project
This repo is meant for practicing html and css by curating a virtual Resume. 

I began working on this resume during Intro to Programming for the week 3 github deployment and html/css exercise. (June 2025)

Additional updates added during week 3 of Web Development for the Update Your Github lesson. (July 2025)

Added additional sheets, responsive coding, etc to reflect knowledge gained during module 2 of Web Development pathway. (September 2025)
