                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented individual with a passion for learning and cultivating new skills. Currently I am proud to be working to develop a community promoting tech literacy and entry-level tech career employability in underserved areas of Eastern Kentucky with Code:You as a Regional Community Coordinator. My professional background is in mental/behavioral health treatment in both inpatient and outpatient settings, and most recently I worked with marginalized populations experiencing Substance Use Disorder.
                    I always aim to utilize my written and verbal communication skills, creative interests, and passion for learning while working and pride myself on my ability to maintain performance and professionalism in difficult or fast-paced environments.
                    <br>
                    Originally from Southeast Georgia, I currently I live in Harlan, KY with my husband, our two children, and our french bulldog Ozzy. In my free time I enjoy reading, gaming, baking/cooking, and creating arts & crafts. I am also a huge fan of metal and alternative music.
                    I would love to connect with others supporting the development of tech opportunity in Eastern Kentucky; please feel free to reach out!
