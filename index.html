                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented individual with a passion for learning and cultivating new skills. Currently I am proud to be working to develop a community promoting tech literacy and entry-level tech career employability in underserved areas of Eastern Kentucky with Code:You as a Regional Community Coordinator. My professional background is in mental/behavioral health treatment in both inpatient and outpatient settings, and most recently I worked with marginalized populations experiencing Substance Use Disorder.
                    I always aim to utilize my written and verbal communication skills, creative interests, and passion for learning while working and pride myself on my ability to maintain performance and professionalism in difficult or fast-paced environments.
